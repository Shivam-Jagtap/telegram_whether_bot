# telegram_whether_bot
I created a bot in telegram using nodejs in the backend and by collaborating with API given by telegram .
To run the bot using your local system as the server , copy the entire project and do npm install(to install all required packages to install to your system to run the code)
Now type command - "nodemon src/index.js" or "node src/index.js" to start the server .
Now search for the bot on telegram as - @Delhi_temperature_bot and feel free to use it .
The bot when started will inform you about the temperature at Delhi at that time in EVERY HOUR .
The bot wont stop ever until you type - "/stop" or "stop"
